# Build An Album Store Product Page With Angular

This repo contains the code for the Pluralsight Project "Build An Album Store Product Page With Angular," located here: https://app.pluralsight.com/projects/build-an-album-store-product-page-with-angular/

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

We've also created scripts that correspond to each part of the Pluralsight Project that you can access by running `npm run test:partN`, where `N` is any number 2-7.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
